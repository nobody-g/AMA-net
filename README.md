# AMA-net: 
**Adaptive Multi-Path Aggregation for Human DensePose Estimation In The Wild**

AMA-net is implemented in the [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) framework and [DensePose](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Densepose) Project and is powered by [Caffe2](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2).
In this repository, we provide the code to train and evaluate AMA-net.
